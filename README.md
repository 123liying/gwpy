GWpy
====

Package for analysing and characterising gravitational wave data in python.

This package is heavily influenced by and dependent on [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/), and derives a lot of functionality from the [LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL)](https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/projects/lalsuite.html).

Persons with LIGO.ORG credentials (members of the LSC or Virgo) can view the development-version documentation here:

All members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration can and should claim authorship of this package, given that I've stolen most of other people's code and wrapped it in a user-friendly python package.

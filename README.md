GWpy
====

Package for analysing and characterising gravitational wave data in python.

This package is heavily influenced by and dependent on [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/), and the [LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL)](https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/projects/lalsuite.html).

All members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration can and should claim authorship of this package, given that I've stolen most of other people's code and wrapped it in a user-friendly python package.

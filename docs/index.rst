GWpy is package with a set of worked examples, providing step-by-step tutorials on how to use the GWpy package to study data from gravitational-wave detectors.

The examples are provided in the ``examples/`` directory of the git repository, in both `IPython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ (``.ipynb``) and Python (``.py``) formats. The notebooks are recommended as the ideal tool for viewing the examples, to open them, execute in your shell:

.. code:: bash

   ipython notebook gw_ex_plot_timeseries.ipynb

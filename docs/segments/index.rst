Segment handling (:mod:`gwpy.segments`)
#######################################

The `gwpy.segments` module provides classes and routines for handling data segments.
These segments are used to record the state of the instruments and the quality of their data at any given time.
The following pages give a reference for the objects used to represent segment lists and data-quality flags in GWpy.

The major application of data-quality flags is to record times during which the instrument was operating outside of its nominal condition.
These flags are typically generated by analysing auxiliary signals in the instrument that aren't sensitive to gravitational-wave amplitude, but do have a recorded noise coupling into the main gravitational-wave channel.

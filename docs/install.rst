Installing GWpy
***************

This package is not currently under version control, as it in early development stages. As such, there is no method for installing the codes personally.

However, if you are a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, both the GWpy and astropy packages are installed on all shared computing centres.

If you use the ``bash`` shell, you can source the following script to set up the environment for the GWpy package

.. code-block:: bash

    source /home/duncan.macleod/etc/gwpy-env.sh

or if you use the ``csh`` shell:

.. code-block:: csh

    source /home/duncan.macleod/etc/gwpy-env.csh

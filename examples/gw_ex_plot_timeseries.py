"""GWpy Example: plotting a time-series

Problem
-------

I would like to study the gravitational wave strain time-series around the time of an interesting simulated signal during the last science run (S6). I have access to the frame files on the LIGO Data Grid machine `ldas-pcdev2.ligo-wa.caltech.edu` and so can read them directly.
